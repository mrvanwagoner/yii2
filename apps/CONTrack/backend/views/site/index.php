				<h2>What is CONTrack?</h2>

				<p><!-- This file is located at: <strong>\backend\views\site\index.php</strong> --><!-- CHANGED MVW 03/08/14-->CONTrack is a construction tracking system that integrates the entire construction process from conception to close-out betwen Owner, Builder, Inspector, and Lender, each accessing the Project with their own secure login. Users can also utilize CONTrack independently of other parties to manage non-integrated Projects of their own.</p><!--CHANGED MVW 03/10/14 -->

				<h2>Why use CONTrack?</h2></p><!--CHANGED MVW 03/10/14 -->

        <p>Many typical pitfalls happen during the course of construction, such as multiple/inconsistent cost breakdowns, inconsistent inspections, and unauthorized changes in project specs. CONTrack addresses these issues and helps take the stress out of the process.</p></p><!--CHANGED VJT 03/10/14 -->

				<h2>How does it work?</h2><!--CHANGED MVW 03/10/14 -->

        <p>CONTrack is the Swiss Army Knife of Construction Management Systems. We have tried to conceptualize every tool that is needed in the construction process, and if we happened to miss something that you need... Great! We can add it.
